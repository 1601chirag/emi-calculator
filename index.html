  <h2>How EMI is Calculated</h2>

  <p>
    EMI is calculated using the following formula:
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>
      EMI = P × R × (1 + R)<sup>N</sup> / ((1 + R)<sup>N</sup> − 1)
    </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Where:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>P</strong> = Loan amount</li>
    <li><strong>R</strong> = Monthly interest rate</li>
    <li><strong>N</strong> = Number of monthly installments</li>
  </ul>
